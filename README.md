<h1> About the book </h1>

This book is about TinyML, a fast-growing field at the unique intersection of machine learning and embedded systems to make AI ubiquitous with extremely low-powered devices such as microcontrollers.

TinyML is an exciting field full of opportunities. With a small budget, we can give life to objects that interact with the world around us smartly and transform the way we live for the better. However, this field can be hard to approach if we come from an ML background with a little familiarity with embedded systems such as microcontrollers. Therefore, this book wants to dispel these barriers and make TinyML also accessible to developers with no embedded programming experience through practical examples. Each chapter will be a self-contained project to learn how to use some of the technologies at the heart of TinyML, interface with electronic components like sensors, and deploy ML models on memory-constrained devices.

<h1> Who is this book for </h1>

This book is for ML developers/engineers interested in developing machine learning applications on microcontrollers through practical examples quickly. The book will help you expand your knowledge towards the revolution of tiny machine learning (TinyML) by building end-to-end smart projects with real-world data sensors on **[Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense](https://store.arduino.cc/products/arduino-nano-33-ble-sense)** and **[Raspberry Pi Pico](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-pico/)**.
\
\
Basic familiarity with C/C++, Python programming, and a command-line interface (CLI) is required. However, no prior knowledge of microcontrollers is necessary.

<h1> Technical requirements </h1>

You will need a computer (either a laptop or desktop) with an x86-64 architecture and at least one USB port for programming Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense and Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller boards. For the first six chapters, you can use Ubuntu 18.04 (or later) or Windows (for example, Windows 10) as an operating system (OS). However, you will need Ubuntu 18.04 (or later) for chapter 7 and chapter 8.

The only software prerequisites for your computer are:
* **Python** (Python 3.7 recommended)
* **Text editor** (for example, gedit on Ubuntu)
* **Media player** (for example, VLC)
* **Image viewer** (for example, the default app in Ubuntu or Windows 10)
* **Web browser** (for example, Google Chrome)

Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense and Raspberry Pi Pico programs will be developed directly in the web browser with the **[Arduino Web Editor](https://create.arduino.cc)**. However, you may also consider using the local **[Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)** following the instructions provided at this **[link](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/TinyML-Cookbook/blob/main/Docs/setup_local_arduino_ide.md)**.

The following table summarizes the hardware devices and software tools covered in each chapter:
